## üéØ Your Situation
- ‚úÖ Windows PC only
- ‚ùå No Mac
- ‚ùå No Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- üéØ Goal: Build iOS app for testing/distribution

## üöÄ Best Solutions (Ranked)

### **Option 1: Codemagic (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê**

**What is it?**  
Cloud-based CI/CD service with Mac build machines in the cloud. **You don't need a Mac!**

- ‚úÖ FREE tier: 500 minutes/month (25-30 iOS builds)
- ‚úÖ Can build unsigned apps WITHOUT Apple Developer Account
- ‚úÖ Works from Windows - just push to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Professional build environment
- ‚úÖ Can upgrade later when you get Apple account

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Free tier limited to 500 minutes/month
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Without Apple account, can't distribute to App Store/TestFlight

**Cost:**
- **FREE**: 500 build minutes/month
- **Paid**: $49/month for 3000 minutes (if you need more)

**How to Use:**
```powershell
# 1. Push your code to GitHub (already done!)
git push origin main

# 2. Sign up at https://codemagic.io with GitHub

- ‚úÖ 2000 minutes/month free (macOS)
- ‚úÖ No Mac required
- ‚úÖ Already integrated with GitHub

**Cons:**

**Setup:**
I can create a GitHub Actions workflow for you if you want this option.

### **Option 3: Appetize.io (Browser Testing)**

**What is it?**  
Run iOS apps in a browser simulator - perfect for demos and testing.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No Mac needed
- ‚úÖ No Apple account needed

### **Option 4: VirtualBox macOS (Hackintosh) ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**What is it?**  
Install macOS in VirtualBox on Windows.
